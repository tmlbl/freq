Freq is a browser-based implementation of a binaural beat generator utilizing the latest webkit audio features.

Two oscillators are created and panned to the left and right ears. The frequencies in each ear can be adjusted to within a hundreth of a degree. The spread between frequencies is displayed and can be adjusted in the same fashion as the oscillators. Several background noise sliders allow the user to create a custom mix of ambient sounds and binaural frequencies. The mix can be saved in the form of a url with a short query string attached.

What are Binaural Beats?
-------------------------

From www.monroeinstitute.org:

<pre>
The sensation of auditory binaural beats occurs when two coherent sounds 
of nearly similar frequencies are presented one to each ear with stereo 
headphones or speakers.

The brain integrates the two signals, producing a sensation of a third 
sound called the binaural beat.

For example, if a frequency of 100 Hz is played in one ear and 107 Hz is 
played in the other ear, a binaural beat of 7 Hz is created by the brain.

Brain waves match or “follow” the binaural beat. If
the binaural beat is 7 Hz, an increase in brain waves of 7
Hz occurs.
